# Welcome

These documents and guides log the various installation and configuration procedures of services used in my homelab. Every guide is made while the services are being installed and configured, so they include every step needed to get that service running.

If you spot a problem, please follow the link in the upper-right corner to the Github repository and open an issue or create a pull request. I don't want to spread misinformation, so please point out any problems as soon as possible.
